Let x be the amount of gasoline the driver buys originally.\n2. Let p be the original price per liter.\n3. The new price per liter is 1.2p.\n4. The driver intends to spend only 14% more on gasoline, so the new total cost should be 1.14 times the original cost.\n5. Let y be the new amount of gasoline the driver should buy.\n6. The new total cost is (1.2p)y.\n7. The original total cost is px.\n8. The new total cost should be 1.14 times the original total cost, so (1.2p)y = 1.14(px).\n9. Solving for y, we get y = (1.14/1.2)x = 0.95x.\n10. The driver should reduce the quantity of gasoline by (1 - 0.95)x = 0.05x.\n11. This is a reduction of 5%.\n12. Therefore, the answer is d) 5%.", "source": "mathqa_prepared.jsonl"}
