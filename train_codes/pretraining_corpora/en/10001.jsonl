{"text": "It is done, and submitted. You can play \u201cSurvival of the Tastiest\u201d on Android, and on the web. Playing on the web works, but you have to simulate multi-touch for table moving and that can be a bit confusing.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot I\u2019d like to talk about. I\u2019ll go through every topic, insted of making the typical what went right/wrong list.\n\nConcept\n\nWorking over the theme was probably one of the hardest tasks I had to face.\n\nOriginally, I had an idea of what kind of game I wanted to develop, gameplay wise \u2013 something with lots of enemies/actors, simple graphics, maybe set in space, controlled from a top-down view. I was confident I could fit any theme around it.\n\nIn the end, the problem with a theme like \u201cEvolution\u201d in a game is that evolution is unassisted. It happens through several seemingly random mutations over time, with the most apt permutation surviving. This genetic car simulator is, in my opinion, a great example of actual evolution of a species facing a challenge. But is it a game?\n\nIn a game, you need to control something to reach an objective. That control goes against what evolution is supposed to be like. If you allow the user to pick how to evolve something, it\u2019s not evolution anymore \u2013 it\u2019s the equivalent of intelligent design, the fable invented by creationists to combat the very idea of evolution. Being agnostic and a Pastafarian, that\u2019s not something that rubbed me the right way.\n\nHence, my biggest dillema when deciding what to create was not with what I wanted to create, but with what I did not. I didn\u2019t want to create an \u201cintelligent design\u201d simulator and wrongly call it evolution.\n\nThis is a problem, of course, every other contestant also had to face. And judging by the entries submitted, not many managed to work around it. I\u2019d say the only real solution was through the use of artificial selection, somehow. So far, I haven\u2019t seen any entry using this at its core gameplay.\n\nAlas, this is just a fun competition and after a while I decided not to be as strict with the game idea, and allowed myself to pick whatever I thought would work out.\n\nMy initial idea was to create something where humanity tried to evolve to a next level but had some kind of foe trying to stop them from doing so. I kind of had this image of human souls flying in space towards a monolith or a space baby (all based in 2001: A Space Odyssey of course) but I couldn\u2019t think of compelling (read: serious) mechanics for that.\n\nBorgs were my next inspiration, as their whole hypothesis fit pretty well into the evolution theme. But how to make it work? Are you the borg, or fighting the Borg?\n\nThe third and final idea came to me through my girlfriend, who somehow gave me the idea of making something about the evolution of Pasta. The more I thought about it the more it sounded like it would work, so I decided to go with it.\n\nConversations with my inspiring co-worker Roushey (who also created the \u201cMechanical Underdogs\u201d signature logo for my intros) further matured the concept, as it involved into the idea of having individual pieces of pasta flying around and trying to evolve until they became all-powerful. A secondary idea here was that the game would work to explain how the Flying Spaghetti Monster came to exist \u2013 by evolving from a normal dinner table.\n\nSo the idea evolved more or less into this: you are sitting a table. You have your own plate, with is your \u201cbase\u201d. There are 5 other guests at the table, each with their own plate.\n\nYour plate can spawn little pieces of pasta. You do so by \u201cordering\u201d them through a menu. Some pastas are better than others; some are faster, some are stronger. They have varying costs, which are debited from your credits (you start with a number of credits).\n\nOnce spawned, your pastas start flying around. Their instinct is to fly to other plates, in order to conquer them (the objective of the game is having your pasta conquer all the plates on the table). But they are really autonomous, so after being spawned, you have no control over your pasta (think DotA or LoL creeps).\n\nYour pasta doesn\u2019t like other people\u2019s pasta, so if they meet, they shoot sauce at each other until one dies. You get credits for other pastas your own pasta kill.\n\nOnce a pasta is in the vicinity of a plate, it starts conquering it for its team. It takes around 10 seconds for a plate to be conquered; less if more pasta from the same team are around. If pasta from other team are around, though, they get locked down in their attempt, unable to conquer the plate, until one of them die (think Battlefield\u2019s standard \u201cConquest\u201d mode).\n\nYou get points every second for every plate you own.\n\nOver time, the concept also evolved to use an Italian bistro as its main scenario.\n\nCarlos, Carlos\u2019 Bistro\u2019s founder and owner\n\nSetup\n\nNo major changes were made from my work setup. I used FDT and Starling creating an Adobe AIR (ActionScript) project, all tools or frameworks I already had some knowledge with.\n\nOne big change for me was that I livestreamed my work through a twitch.tv account. This was a new thing for me. As recommended by Roushey, I used a program called XSplit and I got to say, it is pretty amazing. It made the livestream pretty effortless and the features are awesome, even for the free version. It was great to have some of my friends watch me, and then interact with them and random people through chat. It was also good knowing that I was also recording a local version of the files, so I could make a timelapse video later.\n\nKnowing the video was being recorded also made me a lot more self-conscious about my computer use, as if someone was watching over my shoulder. It made me realize that sometimes I spend too much time in seemingly inane tasks (I ended up wasting the longest time just to get some text alignment the way I wanted \u2013 it\u2019ll probably drive someone crazy if they watch it) and that I do way too many typos where writing code. I pretty much spend half of the time writing a line and the other half fixing the crazy characters in it.\n\nMy own stream was probably boring to watch since I was coding for the most time. But livestreaming is one of the cool things to do as a spectator too. It was great seeing other people working \u2013 I had a few tabs opened on my second monitor all the time. It\u2019s actually a bit sad, because if I could, I could have spent the whole weekend just watching other people working! But I had to do my own work, so I\u2019d only do it once in a while, when resting for a bit.\n\nDesign\n\nAlthough I wanted some simple, low-fi, high-contrast kind of design, I ended up going with somewhat realistic (vector) art. I think it worked very well, fitting the mood of the game, but I also went overboard.\n\nFor example: to know the state of a plate (who owns it, who\u2019s conquering it and how much time they have left before conquering it, which pasta units are in the queue, etc), you have to look at the plate\u2019s bill.\n\nThe problem I realized when doing some tests is that people never look at the bill! They think it\u2019s some kind of prop, so they never actually read its details.\n\nPlus, if you\u2019re zoomed out too much, you can\u2019t actually read it, so it\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s going on with the game until you zoom in to the area of a specific plate.\n\nOne other solution that didn\u2019t turn out to be as perfect as I thought was how to indicate who a plate base belongs to. In the game, that\u2019s indicated by the plate\u2019s decoration \u2013 its color denotes the team owner. But it\u2019s something that fits so well into the design that people never realized it, until they were told about it.\n\nIn the end, the idea of going with a full physical metaphor is one that should be done with care. Things that are very important risk becoming background noise, unless the player knows its importance.\n\nOriginally, I wanted to avoid any kind of heads-up display in my game. In the end, I ended up adding it at the bottom to indicate your credits and bases owned, as well as the hideous out-of-place-and-still-not-obvious \u201cCall Waiter\u201d button. But in hindsight, I should have gone with a simple HUD from the start, especially one that indicated each team\u2019s colors and general state of the game without the need for zooming in and out.\n\nDevelopment\n\nDevelopment went fast. But not fast enough.\n\nEven though I worked around 32+ hours for this Ludum Dare, the biggest problem I had to face in the end was overscoping. I had too much planned, and couldn\u2019t get it all done.\n\nContent-wise, I had several kinds of pasta planned (Wikipedia is just amazing in that regard), split into several different groups, from small Pastina to huge Pasta al forno. But because of time constraints, I ended up scratching most of them, and ended up with 5 different types of very small pasta \u2013 barely something to start when talking about the evolution of Pasta.\n\nPastas used in the game. Unfortunately, the macs where never used\n\nWhich is one of the saddest things about the project, really. It had the framework and the features to allow an endless number of elements in there, but I just didn\u2019t have time to draw the rest of the assets needed (something I loved to do, by the way).\n\nOther non-obvious features had to be dropped, too. For example, when ordering some pasta, you were supposed to select what kind of sauce you\u2019d like with your pasta, each with different attributes. Bolognese, for example, is very strong, but inaccurate; Pesto is very accurate and has great range, but it\u2019s weaker; and my favorite, Vodka, would triggers 10% loss of speed on the pasta hit by it.\n\nThe code for that is mostly in there. But in the end, I didn\u2019t have time to implement the sauce selection interface; all pasta ended up using bolognese sauce.\n\nTo-do list: lots of things were not done\n\nActual programming also took a toll in the development time. Having been programming for a while, I like to believe I got to a point where I know how to make things right, but at the expense of forgetting how to do things wrong in a seemingly good way. What I mean is that I had to take a lot of shortcuts in my code to save time (e.g. a lot of singletons references for cross-communication rather than events or observers, all-encompassing check loops, not fast enough) that left a very sour taste in my mouth. While I know I used to do those a few years ago and survive, I almost cannot accept the state my code is in right now.\n\nAt the same time, I do know it was the right thing to do given the timeframe.\n\nOne small thing that had some impact was using a somewhat new platform for me. That\u2019s Starling, the accelerated graphics framework I used in Flash. I had tested it before and I knew how to use it well \u2013 the API is very similar to Flash itself. However, there were some small details that had some impact during development, making me feel somewhat uneasy the whole time I was writing the game. It was, again, the right thing to do, but I should have used Starling more deeply before (which is the conundrum: I used it for Ludum Dare just so I could learn more about it).\n\nArgument and user experience\n\nOne final aspect of the game that I learned is that making the game obvious for your players goes a long way into making it fun. If you have to spend the longest time explaining things, your game is doing something wrong.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly the problem Survival of the Tastiest ultimately faced. It\u2019s very hard for people to understand what\u2019s going on with the game, why, and how. I did have some introductory text at the beginning, but that was a last-minute thing. More importantly, I should have had a better interface or simplified the whole concept so it would be easier for people to understand.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the game itself should be simple. It just means that the experience and interface should be approachable and understandable.\n\nConclusion\n\nI\u2019m extremely happy with what I\u2019ve done and, especially given that this was my first Ludum Dare. However, I feel like I\u2019ve learned a lot of what not to do.\n\nThe biggest problem is overscoping. Like Eric Decker said, the biggest lesson we can learn with this is probably with scoping \u2013 deciding what to do beforehand in a way you can complete it without having to rush and do something half-assed.\n\nI\u2019m sure I will do more Ludum Dares in the future. But if there are any lessons I can take of it, they are to make it simple, to use frameworks and platforms you already have some absolute experience with (otherwise you\u2019ll spend too much time trying to solve easy questions), and to scope for a game that you can complete in one day only (that way, you can actually take two days and make it cool).\n\nThis entry was posted\non Monday, August 27th, 2012 at 10:54 am and is filed under LD #24.\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\nYou can skip to the end and leave a response.

{"text": "Working Women, Special Provision and the Debate on Equality\n\nThere has been considerable coverage in the media recently about the possibility of offering women in employment paid leave from work during their menstrual period. This has generated a broad range of responses relating to long-standing discussions about \u2018equality\u2019 and \u2018difference\u2019: is women\u2019s equality best achieved by treating them the same as men or by making provisions that recognise their differences in terms of physiological constitution and biological functions?\n\nIf the UK introduces such an initiative, it would not be the first country in the contemporary world to do so. Many countries in Asia already make the provision and Russia debated introducing a law in 2013. The policy also has a significant historical precedent. A whole chapter of my book Women Workers in the Soviet Interwar Economy: From \u2018Protection\u2019 to \u2018Equality\u2019 (Macmillan, 1999), based on extensive research conducted for my PhD, is devoted to \u2018Provision for \u201cMenstrual Leave\u201d\u2019.\n\nIn the 1920s, scientific researchers and labour hygiene specialists in the Soviet Union conducted extensive investigations into the impact of menstruation on women\u2019s capacity to work in manual and industrial jobs requiring a significant degree of physical labour. Their recommendations led to two decrees being issued that targeted specific categories of women workers:\n\nDecree \u2018On the release from work during menstruation of machinists and iron press workers working on cutting machines without mechanised gears in the garment industry\u2019, 11 January 1922\n\nDecree \u2018On the working conditions of women tractor and lorry drivers\u2019, 9 May 1931\n\nThese decrees arose from research that suggested, amongst other things, that inadequate seating at machines and on tractors resulted in congestion and tension in the abdomen that was exacerbated during menstruation. In practice, the decrees did not provide for regular absence from work. Women seeking to benefit from the provision had to provide a doctor\u2019s note, similar to the usual requirements for sick leave.\n\nThe official research into the impact of menstruation on women\u2019s capacity to work and the application of the decrees in practice raised a number of issues on both sides of the argument. I offer only a summary of the contemporary research findings and observer commentary here:\n\nFor the provision:\n\u2022 employers have a responsibility to protect the health of their workers and unhealthy, poor and inadequate working environments can have a detrimental impact on women\u2019s reproductive health\n\u2022 women\u2019s labour productivity and output would rise as a result\n\u2022 it is essential to protect the professionalism of certain categories of workers: the debates here centred on performance artists and female theatrical employees engaged in highly physical and intensely emotional work\n\u2022 heavy physical labour and strenuous exercise can lead to disruptions of the menstrual cycle\n\u2022 women\u2019s physical and intellectual capacities are reduced during menstruation; women lose muscular strength and powers of concentration\n\u2022 women\u2019s biological constitution and reproductive functions require specific recognition in law\n\nAgainst the provision:\n\u2022 employers are less likely to appoint women if they are guaranteed paid time off work during menstruation\n\u2022 (often from male workers, who viewed the employment of women as competition) women should not be employed in jobs for which they lack the physical strength and mental capacity\n\u2022 if necessary, women could be transferred to different tasks involving easier work during menstruation\n\u2022 the provision would be open to uneven application and abuse\n\u2022 women cannot expect to be considered equal with men if they are given special treatment in the law\n\nIt is worth noting also that the various research projects often revealed that the vast majority of women reported no regular problems or abnormalities with menstruation, and that men commonly reported higher levels of sickness than their female colleagues. Many of the problems experienced by women in the workplace could be mitigated by the introduction of improvements to their physical working conditions (not sitting down or standing up in the same position for long periods of time) or by the simple introduction of very short breaks that would allow women to walk around and get some exercise.\n\nDebates in the UK, on the TV and in the press, are unlikely to reach a consensus on this issue.
